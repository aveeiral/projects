Hi,

I have scraped some information from a sample website.The url to that website is given below.

url :https://www.creativeshrimp.com/top-30-artworks-of-beeple.html

The above website contains multiple pictures of some artist.I have extracted the name and the dimensions of those pictures.For this I used Python(3.6+) as my scripting language.I have also used a few libraries for this task:
1)BeautifulSoup - used for extracting the data from the html file.
2)requests - getting a successful response from the server. 
3)pandas -to perform operations on the list and to convert the list to a comma separated value file.

I have also attached the source code of the html file(source_code_text), the python file(scrape_website) and the final csv file(list_1.csv).
Please find the attachments.

Please review it and let me know if any changes are required

Thanks.
