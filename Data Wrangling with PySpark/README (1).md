# Wrangling_PySpark
#### This repo contains a python jupyter notebook and a simple soccer data for novice to get started on PySpark using their local machines (single node cluster). 
I have come across several frustrating tutorials on PySpark promising to teach new PySpark users with simple to follow shortcuts in under five minutes. I have found them to be click baits and lack the necessary depth to get beginners started and keep them rolling. Both the dataset and the code are included in this repo. Happy Learning!
