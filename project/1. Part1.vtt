00:00.900 --> 00:08.410
So this is a relatively smaller and simpler problem but this will give you a good idea how to build

00:08.410 --> 00:12.510
up linear regression and there will be few challenges across my doing it.

00:12.750 --> 00:18.980
So these are things we are going to walk out of this there's a Chinese company let's call it tech of

00:19.040 --> 00:19.850
Chinese.

00:20.160 --> 00:26.640
And they want to let's say enter into the U.S. market so the automobile company will want to enter into

00:26.640 --> 00:33.480
this market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and then they want to produce the cars locally

00:33.490 --> 00:37.700
to give the competition to the U.S. and European counterpart.

00:37.770 --> 00:44.190
Now they have contracted an automobile concerting company to understand the factors on which the pricing

00:44.190 --> 00:50.720
of the car DePrince specifically they want to understand a factor affecting the uprising of the car

00:50.810 --> 00:56.320
in American market since those may be different for Chinese market specially.

00:56.330 --> 01:03.470
The company wants to know what all the values which are going to be significant in predicting the price

01:03.470 --> 01:04.530
of the car.

01:04.700 --> 01:10.610
So they want to specifically figure out that of what are those factors which are going to impact the

01:10.650 --> 01:12.220
rising column here.

01:12.470 --> 01:15.810
And how will those Maribel's described the price of the car.

01:16.070 --> 01:22.940
So based on various markets or whether consulting some have gathered a large data set of different type

01:22.940 --> 01:30.590
of cost across the American market and the business goal is that you are required to model the price

01:30.590 --> 01:37.250
of the US with the available independent partners and it will be used by the management to understand

01:37.250 --> 01:40.860
how exactly the prices vary with the independent variable.

01:41.150 --> 01:47.240
They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cost the business that GSX route to meet the certain

01:47.240 --> 01:53.030
price limit for the other model will be a good way for the management to understand the pricing dynamic

01:53.030 --> 01:54.000
in the new market.

01:54.350 --> 01:57.670
And we also have to do some bit of repression here.

01:57.740 --> 02:03.830
There is a valuable core that's got God's name which is going to be comprised of two but the first word

02:03.950 --> 02:06.200
will be card as a card company.

02:06.290 --> 02:08.330
And the second will be our car model.

02:08.510 --> 02:14.770
For example if it is an international late Impala then Chevrolet is going to be our car company name

02:14.770 --> 02:16.480
and Impala will be a car model.

02:16.670 --> 02:23.150
So you need to consider only the company name as an independent variable for model building up again.

02:23.180 --> 02:30.300
I have given you even the directionally along with it and this dataset is also available in U.S. repository.

02:30.560 --> 02:35.930
So you can also get all that data set is this data set will be easily available outside.

02:35.950 --> 02:42.500
And in fact you might want to see some solutions on Galgal for this Asmund so but this is a quite simple

02:42.500 --> 02:43.600
problem.

02:43.670 --> 02:47.000
If I compare with other problems I found that it is a drawback.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.430
This is going to give you a good insight on leaner readership.

02:50.660 --> 02:55.100
So that's the reason I have chosen to keep it inside this particular course.
