00:00.520 --> 00:04.890
OK so now are we going to go with the six features later.

00:05.220 --> 00:11.240
So we gonna basically look at this fact we are going to take the final model with six features and a

00:11.250 --> 00:12.910
bird that's all good.

00:13.170 --> 00:19.140
And remember I'm using this Euless method to do this than we are doing this prediction and all that

00:19.140 --> 00:25.230
doing to somebody looking at the SKU out of just enough square calculating the odds squares call for

00:25.660 --> 00:26.960
this data.

00:26.970 --> 00:32.110
Now what we going to do is we're going to evaluate a final more and we're going to see that whether

00:32.140 --> 00:33.440
this model is good or not.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.220
So there are a few things we need to Nortel though.

00:37.430 --> 00:42.990
What you're getting so should be kind of approximately near to zero so the distribution should be more

00:43.000 --> 00:43.960
around zero.

00:44.220 --> 00:50.090
Second thing is there should be not much sort of correlation between the predictors So we will see the

00:50.130 --> 00:51.740
six Latimer's 16:00 guard.

00:51.780 --> 00:56.820
They should not be too much of the correlation between them and the third thing is we will look at the

00:57.540 --> 00:58.730
spread of the variance.

00:58.730 --> 01:01.210
Basically a part we want to check.

01:01.210 --> 01:06.210
Basically there's almost kind of safety feature but if we don't know about that you have to be worried

01:06.210 --> 01:09.520
about this but this is a linear regression as.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.560
What we do have.

01:10.830 --> 01:12.610
Now look at this.

01:12.660 --> 01:18.210
So when we plotted this erratum you can see that the value is more more or less kind of at zero.

01:18.210 --> 01:24.000
In fact what we can do is we can see other plot which is Leiter's minus vibrate and you can see that

01:24.000 --> 01:29.850
this is around zero and if we calculate the mean value does really tell us that we are coming around

01:29.850 --> 01:32.380
minus 1:57 which is almost close to zero.

01:32.400 --> 01:37.220
Because if you look at the whole distribution this minus 32 is not a very.

01:37.230 --> 01:42.110
Time now for the two that we can see the distribution of this plot.

01:42.150 --> 01:47.880
Now let's look at the multi-collinearity for that we can draw a heat map we can see that yes at some

01:47.880 --> 01:54.450
places we do have of some sort of correlation but at the same time it's your call today because when

01:54.450 --> 01:57.870
I tried to move it up it was increasing that distance.

01:58.170 --> 02:03.240
So if you want to kind of maybe try removing some of the thing and can compromise with a little bit

02:03.240 --> 02:04.470
of a distance.

02:04.770 --> 02:10.350
But for now I can go with the 6 features and get tell to my company that OK.

02:10.380 --> 02:14.590
You can probably use this Gollum's as the main predictor for the price.

02:14.730 --> 02:17.730
So this is accordingly you can give the pricing part for it.

02:17.750 --> 02:20.910
This is a very simple project on.

02:21.090 --> 02:26.850
I would not even call it a project it's a simple case to me which I did it for a linear regression so

02:26.850 --> 02:34.080
that you at least get up from starting to end without using PC on a bigger column that are set up to

02:34.080 --> 02:40.720
solve something and come up with a model how to choose a better model from all the other models for

02:40.720 --> 02:41.730
pure greed.

02:41.970 --> 02:45.200
And we're also seeing the our fee kind of usage in this case.

02:45.220 --> 02:50.310
But I want to give you an assignment here and you have to try with PC and this thing and see that folks.
