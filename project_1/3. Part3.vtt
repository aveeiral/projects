00:00.860 --> 00:05.300
Now we are going to perform some data cleaning and data processing part.

00:05.310 --> 00:06.880
So let's look at information.

00:06.900 --> 00:12.260
This is all we have and you can notice that we don't have much of the missing values or in fact non-missing

00:12.280 --> 00:17.500
value here so that it is given to clean and that does not alter that.

00:17.640 --> 00:24.270
So that's the reason I was telling you it's a relatively simple problem in assembling walls into 20

00:24.390 --> 00:29.340
so let's convert it to object let's treat it as categorical as I explained to you as well.

00:29.660 --> 00:30.710
So we have done that.

00:30.750 --> 00:33.090
And now let's look at your car name.

00:33.120 --> 00:38.820
Remember in the car name it was mentioned in the problem statement that we should pull up the first

00:38.820 --> 00:39.900
entry from there.

00:40.170 --> 00:44.120
So we were de-coupled the BMW let's say from BMW X-1.

00:44.130 --> 00:49.220
Similarly BMX BMW X3 will be treated as only BMW.

00:49.500 --> 00:53.740
So now let's take over the obvious printing of the 0 8 index and this is the read.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.080
But now this is also kind of renewal for iPhone and all that.

00:57.090 --> 01:02.850
So let's basically bring it and use a regular expression to bring it properly so that's what we're doing

01:03.200 --> 01:03.880
now.

01:04.060 --> 01:10.890
Now once we are done with this up we can just physically apply this up and now you can see that all

01:10.890 --> 01:12.770
those dash everything is gone.

01:13.020 --> 01:19.290
Now once we have done one thing you'll notice that there are a lot of spelling mistake like of one.

01:19.290 --> 01:22.260
Also you can what is that let's say Nissan is an invention.

01:22.620 --> 01:29.460
And some will basically here you will also and in fact you can also see Toyota have a wrong spelling.

01:29.460 --> 01:30.850
You have a VW here.

01:30.880 --> 01:31.650
We other ones.

01:31.700 --> 01:32.520
They're going here.

01:32.700 --> 01:35.160
And so what they are from the sun as well.

01:35.180 --> 01:36.030
Sure you.

01:36.210 --> 01:40.340
So you will notice that my is starting with capital and degrade.

01:40.340 --> 01:41.760
So one is smaller.

01:41.770 --> 01:43.290
And second is opportunity.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.820
So there are a lot of mistakes mythically here which need to be fixed.

01:47.040 --> 01:53.820
So I've mentioned all those things like VW and Bolz-Weber should be was vegan are similarly posh spelling

01:53.820 --> 01:59.240
is wrong or does faling is wrong and so to me I've just written a simple python code to fix it.

01:59.430 --> 02:03.490
Once this is done begin again look at that I look around and so on.

02:03.660 --> 02:09.050
Now further to this we can drop the Garnham because we have already derived the column which we want.

02:09.150 --> 02:12.530
And then after that we can just look at the data.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.950
Everything looks good.

02:13.950 --> 02:15.730
Look at the information things look good.

02:15.750 --> 02:17.910
Let's go to the application Chris.

02:18.050 --> 02:23.610
So not the sort of collection you have so we are surprised about X and Y and what we need to do for

02:23.610 --> 02:28.520
all the categorical column we need to create dummy ratable So that's what we're doing in the next phase.

02:28.710 --> 02:31.640
Once we are done with the next step.

02:31.650 --> 02:37.440
So we have created a dummy and all that we can drop local or regional categorical column because that's

02:37.440 --> 02:41.960
what we don't need and get merge done the Miss column which we have just created.

02:42.150 --> 02:47.520
Once we're done with this we have to scale it up so we are basically taking the step here to kill all

02:47.520 --> 02:48.470
these things up.

02:48.810 --> 02:54.670
And once we have still the data now we are going to spread it to to 70 to 80 percent of it.

02:55.320 --> 03:01.890
So if we notice now and moving to this project very quickly because all these things if you have done

03:01.890 --> 03:07.830
my machine running quartet's and I have done it in the case Turley's there it just that definitely this

03:07.830 --> 03:12.080
is a kind of little bigger project than that and we have to look at multiple things.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.060
But at the same time these attacks we have done it.

03:15.100 --> 03:20.020
So that's the reason I'm moving little faster zooming that you know this if you have not done all this

03:20.020 --> 03:25.290
you need to first go and can invoke on the machine when it goes before you kind of jump to the product

03:25.290 --> 03:26.040
section Darcie.
