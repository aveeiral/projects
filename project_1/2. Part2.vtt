00:01.140 --> 00:04.790
So now we're going to divide this problem into four parts.

00:04.800 --> 00:11.760
But before I go into the solution again the same request of Please do try to solve it refasten and run.

00:11.880 --> 00:18.780
And this is relatively a simpler problem any further problem it is going to come is going to be much

00:18.780 --> 00:20.980
more complex than this problem.

00:21.060 --> 00:27.300
So I would strongly recommend all of you to please try to do it on your own first rather than up looking

00:27.300 --> 00:28.320
at the solution.

00:28.560 --> 00:32.930
And especially you should look at the data and it's not evil because if you're not clear on that you

00:32.930 --> 00:37.210
tangentally you will not be able to understand what I'm going to explain you in this.

00:37.230 --> 00:38.520
I'm not going to go there.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.540
Actually this is something which you have to do.

00:41.570 --> 00:44.770
My focus would be to understand me to understand the problem.

00:46.210 --> 00:48.760
So here there are the four steps we're going to follow.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.850
One is to understand the data then we will do the cleaning.

00:51.860 --> 00:54.030
Back then we will do the preparation part.

00:54.130 --> 00:56.840
Then we will build the model and evaluate it.

00:57.190 --> 01:02.020
So let's look at the first part where we can explore and understand it.

01:02.290 --> 01:04.340
So first we need to import these packages.

01:04.360 --> 01:09.520
And we need to load this place of assignment which I've given to use us to solve it.

01:09.970 --> 01:15.630
And then we can look at the information or we can see that this is all the data what we have we can

01:15.630 --> 01:20.430
see though of basically the state of quickly this is the data of what we can see here.

01:20.680 --> 01:24.160
Now let's try to understand the data dictionary.

01:24.160 --> 01:30.810
So once you have done this you can see one part which is stumbling the one column albedo which the North

01:30.810 --> 01:37.380
that minus two means less risky and plus three means more risky so the valuable billion or minus two

01:37.420 --> 01:38.500
plus three.

01:38.500 --> 01:42.730
So what we're going to do we will come back how many values are available here so we can do all that

01:42.730 --> 01:46.560
you can for that and can see that there are basically zero.

01:46.570 --> 01:53.470
Which is like neutral kind of back where they are 67 in above but minus 2 minus 1 is also having some

01:53.470 --> 01:54.090
code.

01:54.400 --> 02:00.910
Now Similarly you will see another variable called the suspension this is an internal combustion engine

02:01.330 --> 02:06.920
are properties showing red and oxygen intake is through standard or through turbocharging.

02:07.030 --> 02:11.600
So that is basically aspiration if you read through it and actually this detail is there.

02:11.770 --> 02:18.340
So let's convert it to categorical because we have only two and we can call that standard or just like

02:18.340 --> 02:22.440
168 in total and Turbo is like 37 in total.

02:22.750 --> 02:29.560
Now let's do it for gravey and front wheel or for which we can see here that this is all the distribution

02:29.560 --> 02:31.960
for Dr B is going to look like.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.540
Now look at four wheel base.

02:33.540 --> 02:39.090
Now for the base we have just done our distribution plot because again this is kind of a numeric value.

02:39.160 --> 02:44.330
So when we do this you can see that most of the values are falling around 90.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.740
Right so the middle are ninety two hundred.

02:46.930 --> 02:47.840
This is falling more.

02:48.010 --> 02:52.560
Similarly when I did it for code grade up and then the solution is going well.

02:52.780 --> 02:57.240
We have done it for stroke also to see that where the maximum values are coming up.

02:57.520 --> 03:01.060
And similar thing we have done it for compression ratio.

03:01.060 --> 03:05.400
In fact you can see in compression ratio things are moving towards the right hand side as well.

03:05.710 --> 03:11.570
Now we have done it for pricing also and you can see that most of the casings are around like ten thousand

03:11.570 --> 03:12.300
cents on average.

03:12.310 --> 03:14.920
So that's what of the pleasing maxim coming up.

03:14.930 --> 03:21.970
Now let's do some data exploration now in order to before we are playing at ignition it's always better

03:21.970 --> 03:24.240
to look at the correlation in on.

03:24.400 --> 03:30.460
So maybe one thing we need to do is we need to look out first all the pneumatic and fluid balance because

03:31.260 --> 03:35.540
definitely we cannot do the correlations or looking at the paper plot.

03:35.620 --> 03:38.110
We cannot look at all that on the categorical data.

03:38.110 --> 03:41.380
So we have to look at all these things from the numerical data.

03:41.590 --> 03:47.010
So we will pull out only the floor an integer value and you will notice that there is there are two

03:47.020 --> 03:49.000
columns like symbole right next door.

03:49.030 --> 03:54.340
It is integer but we will treat it like a vertical because you have six values so you will not make

03:54.340 --> 03:56.960
much inference if you treat your like Domanick.

03:57.010 --> 03:58.410
So now what are you going to do.

03:58.450 --> 04:03.250
We have dropped the simile and when we can also drop cards and remember we are dropping it from the

04:03.250 --> 04:05.980
pneumatic ratable not from anything else.

04:06.010 --> 04:10.220
So when we are done that now further to this we can draw up here plot.

04:10.360 --> 04:16.120
So we are going to pay a lot for all the car pneumatics basically which are integer float and we can

04:16.120 --> 04:17.120
see this.

04:17.380 --> 04:22.570
If you want to again go ahead and try to see some nice literature it's very difficult for me to look

04:22.570 --> 04:28.390
at it without a microscope because there are so much of fusion of multi-column to matter thing is maybe

04:28.390 --> 04:33.640
we can look at the correlation metrics and the correlation although it will be difficult so let's draw

04:33.640 --> 04:38.860
our heat map and this map tell you quite interesting thing which I have noted down below.

04:39.190 --> 04:46.000
So fast as you can see the prize is highly are positively correlated with Beebe's Garland Garbett and

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
KOBRICK engine size horsepower.

04:49.210 --> 04:53.700
Notice how all these ratable represent the size weight engine power of the car.

04:53.800 --> 05:00.490
So definitely even if you think from your own personal experience these are the things that impact your

05:00.490 --> 05:06.500
car racing and the same if you look at WCA and you will notice that there will be more closer to one.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.210
That's the reason.

05:07.210 --> 05:08.880
These are highly correlated.

05:09.100 --> 05:16.570
Similarly if you look at the city MPG and highway mpg they basically it will be like minus 0.7 in this

05:16.570 --> 05:17.990
match up with double glove.

05:18.190 --> 05:22.060
So they are negatively correlated with the price.

05:22.060 --> 05:29.020
This suggests that maybe the car is having a higher mileage rate they might be put in place so you can

05:29.020 --> 05:31.330
think of like a middle class family.

05:31.420 --> 05:34.550
Are they kind of prefer to go with Model-T and all that.

05:34.550 --> 05:35.250
It's a.

05:35.270 --> 05:36.470
Eat and drink.

05:36.650 --> 05:38.470
If I'm talking about Indian market.

05:38.470 --> 05:44.050
So the reason they do that because they look at the average are no more than us forward or anything

05:44.050 --> 05:45.540
else so they don't bother about much.

05:45.720 --> 05:52.910
Things that mileage Similarly you will notice some correlation among independent farmers like me.

05:52.960 --> 05:57.110
Basically you will see that really based Karlan go with engine size.

05:57.260 --> 06:00.000
They are all the measure of leg size by weight.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.740
That's the reason they are all positively correlated.

06:02.750 --> 06:08.790
Right now this is this becomes a very important factor and you cannot really ignore it because you have

06:08.790 --> 06:16.020
to make sure that you do need to remove all those multicollinearity before you create a final model

06:16.020 --> 06:16.650
for yourself.

06:16.650 --> 06:18.200
This is a very important factor.
