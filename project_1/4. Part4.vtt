00:00.810 --> 00:03.020
So now we're going to build the model.

00:03.090 --> 00:08.920
So we're going to use the linear regression and going to fit the train and just look at the coefficient

00:08.920 --> 00:15.780
and intercept the value which is coming up from this and we can do the prediction on the set and when

00:15.780 --> 00:21.170
we did this and calculate the odds what you will notice that we got 83 percent quarters.

00:21.510 --> 00:22.630
Okay not bad.

00:23.010 --> 00:25.390
But remember this is on a huge set of call.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.410
We would like to or kind of decrease them.

00:28.600 --> 00:35.670
So in this case Tony I'm not going to Zune PC knowledge at the moment so I'm going to go with respect

00:35.670 --> 00:41.130
to some people out of the matter because I want to show you that how to use our fee even in this.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.160
Feel free to use PC or PC any.

00:44.190 --> 00:51.780
As for your wish now let's say 15 features if we go Glaxo me daddy going to lose it to 15.

00:52.020 --> 00:55.890
So we can just go and look at the rankings support and all that.

00:55.910 --> 00:57.120
To the prediction.

00:57.120 --> 00:58.360
Look at our squad.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.270
So we got 89 percent which is good right.

01:01.290 --> 01:03.080
We are getting a better accuracy.

01:03.260 --> 01:03.540
Ms.

01:03.540 --> 01:11.150
A-squared free then we can go with 6 or 6 Also we did a prediction or none and now we got it yet again.

01:11.220 --> 01:17.400
So we got this value but up which one we should choose like should go for 6.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.770
Or should we go for 15.

01:18.810 --> 01:19.310
Right.

01:19.500 --> 01:24.590
But actually we should not look at as what we have to also look at it to.

01:24.630 --> 01:31.210
That's one of the important metric and is to get that and just tell us what we need to use the tax model.

01:31.230 --> 01:34.970
So let's now create this model again Gingrich that's model.

01:35.220 --> 01:41.660
So now I'm going to create with two columns first and then you're going to do it with the summary or

01:41.730 --> 01:47.760
you would come across basically of dystrophin some ninety three point nine percent of US strategy numbers

01:47.760 --> 01:50.660
are stacked model so things can go a little different.

01:50.670 --> 01:53.370
And I just told us querist mindedly pointed.

01:53.650 --> 02:00.690
Now let's begin with the prediction by adding constant and then doing a prediction that and then look

02:00.690 --> 02:03.570
at that score which is zero point it nine.

02:03.780 --> 02:08.720
So although the training was NOT KNOW line 3 but on the test in 0.11.

02:08.730 --> 02:13.030
And for me it's more important to look at the test rather than on the plane.

02:13.500 --> 02:20.490
Now after that we can basically go and apply for the six columns again applying all the same stacks

02:20.940 --> 02:28.150
and with six I got all basically R-squared off in nine and basically idiot point five right on the test

02:28.150 --> 02:28.750
set.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.930
So this is what we are getting.

02:30.930 --> 02:33.790
For us to spike now what should we go for.

02:33.870 --> 02:36.420
Should we go for 15 or 16 or 17.

02:36.420 --> 02:37.700
We are getting a little better.

02:37.720 --> 02:42.940
Actually our square in comparison to 6 but what we can do.

02:42.990 --> 02:48.400
Well Mark can we stop at six centers in our trying it for about trying it.

02:48.660 --> 02:56.070
So in order to do that how about we treat it as a hyper power meter and create kind of a function which

02:56.070 --> 02:59.080
will run from 4 to let's say.

02:59.400 --> 03:06.230
And we will see that how I just R-squared and everything is coming up and we can plot a graph for it.

03:06.690 --> 03:13.180
So this is a simple function being created for what is going to run from 4 to 20 and you can notice

03:13.200 --> 03:19.410
that in this particular code we have basically written this predicted us crack and then we are just

03:19.410 --> 03:24.620
plotting this test as courtliness square and adjusted R-squared in this case.

03:24.900 --> 03:31.470
And you can notice that the star Square is deglazing after the Basically value somewhere around 12 or

03:31.470 --> 03:32.140
13.

03:32.310 --> 03:36.640
So we should not even look at and evaluate than tool because it is decreasing.

03:36.870 --> 03:43.230
And if you look at this value between 11:54 its kind of not moving much especially if you look at test

03:43.450 --> 03:44.120
script.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.840
So we really like to go with more simpler model.

03:46.860 --> 03:50.070
So I would choose the value 6 in this case.

03:50.220 --> 03:55.830
Now again you would have noticed that and not Bocking with respect to each and every line of code because

03:56.310 --> 04:02.970
again I'm going with an assumption that you know this is only giving you a patent which you need to

04:02.970 --> 04:08.450
follow and please not to each line of code on your own if you have any problem reasoned discussion forum

04:08.490 --> 04:13.090
but please you have to do everything on your own and your own.

04:13.350 --> 04:14.430
You should not do.

04:14.430 --> 04:17.110
The way I'm doing this is just for an explanation.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.730
But but you're definitely right on that score.

04:19.750 --> 04:22.340
Buy it or if you want to become a good scientist.
